Deploying RenderShield

This document describes how to deploy prerendered output generated by RenderShield so that crawlers receive complete static HTML while users continue to receive your application.

RenderShield does not run your app.
It only produces files and optional routing logic.

If RenderShield builds successfully, the output is safe to deploy.

1. Build

From the RenderShield project root:

npm install
npm run build

This generates prerendered output in:

dist-prerender/

Typical contents:

dist-prerender/
├─ content/
│ └─ example/
│ └─ index.html
├─ sitemap.xml
├─ robots.txt
└─ worker.js

The exact structure depends on your configured routes.

2. Hosting the prerendered output

You must host the contents of dist-prerender/ on a static origin that can serve files directly.

The static origin must be able to serve:

/content/example/index.html
/sitemap.xml
/robots.txt

Common options include:

a static hosting bucket

a CDN-backed static site

the same host as your SPA, under a different path or subdomain

RenderShield does not require a specific host.

3. Routing crawlers to prerendered HTML (optional but recommended)

To ensure crawlers receive prerendered HTML while humans receive your app, you must route requests based on user-agent.

RenderShield provides an optional Cloudflare Worker (worker.js) for this purpose.

The worker:

detects crawler user agents

rewrites matching routes to prerendered index.html

forwards human traffic unchanged

Humans keep the SPA.
Crawlers get static HTML.

4. Deploying the Cloudflare Worker

Create a Cloudflare account (free plan is sufficient).

Deploy worker.js as a Worker.

Attach the Worker to your domain with a route:

yourdomain.com/*
www.yourdomain.com/
*

Without a route, the Worker will never run.

Ensure the DNS record for your domain is proxied (orange cloud ON).

5. SSL configuration

In Cloudflare:

Set SSL/TLS mode to:

Full
or
Full (Strict)

Do not use “Flexible”.

Incorrect SSL mode can cause redirect loops that prevent crawlers from reaching prerendered content.

6. Sitemap and robots

Upload these files from dist-prerender/ to your static origin:

sitemap.xml
robots.txt

Then submit your sitemap URL to your search engine consoles as needed.

Example robots.txt:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml

7. Verification

RenderShield includes a verification command that prints smoke tests.

Run:

node dist/cli.js verify

This prints three checks:

Human request (should return your app shell)

Crawler request (should return prerendered HTML)

Debug headers (confirms worker routing)

If verification passes, deployment is correct.

8. What RenderShield guarantees

RenderShield guarantees only this:

If a page builds successfully, the generated HTML:

contains real content

includes required metadata

is readable by crawlers

RenderShield does not guarantee:

rankings

traffic

indexing speed

AI citations

It guarantees correctness of output.

9. Common failure modes

If crawlers do not see prerendered content:

Worker route is missing or incorrect

DNS proxy is OFF

Static origin is unreachable

SSL mode is misconfigured

Prerendered files are not deployed

RenderShield verification output will point to these issues.

Summary

RenderShield separates responsibilities cleanly:

Your app serves users

RenderShield serves crawlers

The edge decides who gets what

If it builds, it ships.

That is the contract.
